  - title: "Stop Debating in Code Reviews. Start Enforcing with Lint Rules."
    description: As engineers, we're not designed to remember every detail in the architecture of our projects. But fortunately, we can write the lint rules that will do that for us.

  - title: "Put Your Tests on a Diet: Testing the Behavior and Not the Implementation"
    description: How do you write tests? How much time do you spend writing tests? And how much time do you spend fixing them when refactoring? A few short years ago, we would test a class in JUnit by stacking one test after the other, mocking each one of its dependencies. But for large apps, writing tests in this way without any consideration of architecture can easily become a bottleneck.
